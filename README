This assignment will explore three different web-based attacks: SQL Injection
(SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

The tasks will all use docker images that have fully-configured
servers that are vulnerable to the various attacks.  Make sure there
is no service on your machine listening on ports 8081, 8082, or
8083. It is unlikely that there is. All docker images are available on
ELMS, and should be installed with `docker image load` in the same way
as for the baseline.

For the Java code you will be writing, please ensure that it is
compliant with Java 1.8.


SQL Injection Attacks
---------------------

Your goal in these tasks is to find ways to exploit the SQL-Injection
vulnerabilities and demonstrate the damage that can be achieved by the attacks.

Steps for running docker image:

1. Start the server by running

    docker run -d -p 8081:80 --name sql_server sqli

2. You can access the server in your browser at

    http://localhost:8081/

If you want to examine files in the container, you have several options:

    1. docker exec -ti sql_server bash
    2. docker exec sql_server cat <filename>
    3. docker cp sql_server:<filename> <local filename>

The first option gives you a shell on the running container, though the commands
available to you are somewhat limited. The second will simply dump the contents
of the file (replace <filename> with the full path to the file) to STDOUT. The
third will copy the file to a local name, and behaves very similarly to the
normal "cp" command.

For these tasks, the server you are attacking is called Collabtive, which is a
web-based project management system. It has several user accounts configured.
To see all the users' account information, first log in as the admin using the
following password; other users' account information can be obtained from the
post on the front page.

    username: admin 
    password: admin

Task 1: SQL Injection Attack on SELECT Statements

  In this task, you need to manage to log into Collabtive without providing a
  password. You can achieve this using SQL injections. Normally, before users
  start using Collabtive, they need to login using their user names and
  passwords. Collabtive displays a login window to users and ask them to input
  their username and password. The authentication is implemented by
  include/class.user.php in the Collabtive root directory (i.e.,
  /var/www/html/). It uses the user-provided data to find out whether they match
  with the username and user password fields of any record in the database. If
  there is a match, it means the user has provided a correct user name and
  password combination, and should be allowed to login. Like most web
  applications, PHP programs interact with their back-end databases using the
  standard SQL language. In Collabtive, the following SQL query is constructed
  in class.user.php to authenticate users:

    $sel1 = mysql_query ("SELECT ID, name, locale, lastlogin, gender, 
                          FROM USERS_TABLE 
                          WHERE (name = '$user' OR email = '$user') AND pass = '$pass'");
    
    $chk = mysql_fetch_array($sel1);
    
    if (found one record) 
        then {allow the user to login}

  In the above SQL statement, the USERS TABLE is a macro in PHP, and will be
  replaced by the users table named user. The variable $user holds the string
  typed in the Username textbox, and $pass holds the string typed in the
  Password textbox. User's inputs in these two textboxs are placed directly in
  the SQL query string.

  Submission: Your task is to login as bob without using his password. Please
  submit a file called task1.txt. The first two lines should be the values you
  entered in the login and password fields surrounded by double quotes. The two
  lines should look exactly as follows, with your inputs in place of the -

    login="-" 
    password="-" 

  Follow this with a short explanation of what your input causes to happen.

Task 2: SQL Injection on UPDATE Statements

  In this task, you need to make an unauthorized modification to the database.
  Your goal is to modify another user's profile using SQL injections. In
  Collabtive, if users want to update their profiles, they can go to "My
  account", click the "Edit" link, and then fill out a form to update the
  profile information. After the user sends the update request to the server, an
  UPDATE SQL statement will be constructed in include/class.user.php. The
  objective of this statement is to modify the current user's profile
  information in the users table. There is a SQL injection vulnerability in this
  SQL statement. Please find the vulnerability, and then use it to change
  another user's profile without knowing their password. For example, if you are
  logged in as Alice, your goal is to use the vulnerability to modify Bob's
  profile information, including Bob's password. After the attack, you should be
  able to log into Bob's account.

  Submission: Your task is to change Bob's password by modifying a different
  users profile. Please submit a file called task2.txt with the following
  format:

    1: Bob's new password after your injection, wrapped in double quotes.

    2: User whose profile you are modifying (*not* Bob or Admin), without
       quotes.

    3-n: One line for each profile parameter you changed, like so:
           "param"="new value"

         Please note that both the parameter name and new value should be
         wrapped in double quotes, so that we can clearly see any spaces you
         might have added. Also, the parameter name should be exactly as it
         appears in the source code, *not* what you see on the webpage. You
         will have to examine the HTML or network traffic for these.

    n+1: A blank line 

    n+2 to end: The remaining lines should contain a short write up explaining
                the steps you used to create a working SQL injection attack that
                updates Bob's password to a new value.

For the SQL Injection attacks, your repository should include:

  task1.txt 
  task2.txt 


XSS Attack
----------

Your goal in these tasks is to find ways to exploit the Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities and demonstrate the damage that can be achieved by the attacks.

Steps for running docker image:

1. Start the server by running

    docker run -d -p 8082:80 --name xss_server xss

2. You can access the server in your browser at

    http://localhost:8082/

For these tasks, the server you are attacking is called Elgg, which is a social
networking application. It has several user accounts configured, with the
following credentials:

    USER     USERNAME  PASSWORD
    Admin    admin     seedelgg
    Alice    alice     seedalice
    Boby     boby      seedboby
    Charlie  charlie   seedcharlie
    Samy     samy      seedsamy

  Warmup - No submission Necessary 

    The objective of this task is to embed a JavaScript program in your Elgg
    profile, such that when another user views your profile, the JavaScript
    program will be executed and an alert window will be displayed. The
    following JavaScript program will display an alert window:  
 	
      <script>alert('XSS')</script> 

    If you embed the above JavaScript code in your profile (e.g. in the brief
    description field), then any user who views your profile will see the alert
    window.
  
    In this case, the JavaScript code is short enough to be typed into the short
    description field. If you want to run a long JavaScript, but you are limited
    by the number of characters you can type in the form, you can store the
    JavaScript program in a standalone file, save it with the .js extension, and
    then refer to it using the src attribute in the <script> tag. See the
    following example: 
 
      <script type = "text/javascript"   
        src = http://www.example.com/myscripts.js>  
      </script> 
 
    In the above example, the page will fetch the JavaScript program from
    http://www.example.com, which can be any web server. 

    Our next objective is to embed a JavaScript program in your Elgg profile,
    such that when another user views your profile, the user's cookies will be
    displayed in the alert window. This can be done by adding some additional
    code to the JavaScript program in the previous example:  
  
      <script>alert(document.cookie);</script> 

Task 3: Stealing Cookies from the Victim's machine 

  In the previous task, the malicious JavaScript code written by the attacker
  can print out the user's cookies, but only the user can see the cookies, not
  the attacker. In this task, the attacker wants the JavaScript code to send the
  cookies to themselves. To achieve this, the malicious JavaScript code needs to
  send an HTTP request to the attacker, with the cookies appended to the
  request.
 
  We can do this by having the malicious JavaScript insert an <img> tag with src
  attribute set to the attacker's machine. When the JavaScript inserts the img
  tag, the browser tries to load the image from the URL in the src field; this
  results in an HTTP GET request sent to the attacker's machine. Your JavaScript
  code should send the cookies to the port 5555 of the attacker's machine,
  where the attacker has a TCP server listening to the same port. The server can
  print out whatever it receives. The TCP server program will be given to you.
 
  Note: To build the TCP echo server, type "make" in the echoserver directory to
  compile, and please read the README file on important information regarding
  how to start the server on port 5555. The cookie that will be printed on the
  terminal will be URL encoded.
 
  Submission: Please submit a file called task3.txt. The grading will be done as
  below: We will run the echo server on localhost on port 5555. We will edit the
  brief description field acting as the user Alice using the message contents as
  specified by your task3.txt. Then, when Boby opens this message, Boby's cookie
  should be printed by the echo server.

Task 4: Session Hijacking using the Stolen Cookies   

  After stealing the victim's cookies, the attacker can do whatever the victim
  can do to the Elgg web server, including adding and deleting friends on behalf
  of the victim, deleting the victim's post, etc. Essentially, the attacker has
  hijacked the victim's session. In this task, we will launch this session
  hijacking attack, and write a program to add a friend on behalf of the victim.
 
  To add a friend for the victim, we should first find out how a legitimate user
  adds a friend in Elgg. More specifically, we need to figure out what are sent
  to the server when a user adds a friend. A screenshot of the request is
  provided to you. From the contents, you can identify all the parameters in the
  request.
 
  Once we have understood what the HTTP request for adding friends look like, we
  can write a Java program to send out the same HTTP request. The Elgg server
  cannot distinguish whether the request is sent out by the user's browser or by
  the attacker's Java program. As long as we set all the parameters correctly,
  and the session cookie is attached, the server will accept and process the
  project-posting HTTP request. To simplify your task, we provide you with a
  sample Java program that does the following:

    1. Open a connection to web server.  
    2. Set the necessary HTTP header information.  
    3. Send the request to web server.  
    4. Get the response from web server. 
 
  Note1: Elgg uses two parameters __elgg_ts and __elgg_token. Make sure that you
  set these parameters correctly for your attack to succeed.  Also, please note
  down the correct guid of the friend who needs to be added to the friend list.
  You need to use that guid in the program code for the attack to succeed.

  Note2: You can compile a java program into bytecode by running javac
  HTTPSimpleForge.java on the console. You can run the byte code by running java
  HTTPSimpleForge.  
 
  Submission: Please submit a file called HTTPSimpleForge.java.

  Grading: Your java file will be compiled into byte code and executed. We will
  login as Alice, and try to add Boby as a friend to Alice by running your
  compiled code. Make sure you include the correct guid and parameters in the
  code for the above scenario to execute properly.
 
  Input:  Your java program should read from an input file called
  HTTPSimpleForge.txt. The first line of the input file contains the __elgg_ts
  token (absolute value), the second line contains the __elgg_token (absolute
  value) and the third line would contain the Cookie HTTP header value:

    Elgg=<<cookie value>>

  You can create a text file locally for testing out your code,
  however, you do not need to submit this file as part of your submission. We
  will use our own HTTPSimpleForge.txt file for checking.


CSRF Attack
-----------

Your goal in these tasks is to find ways to exploit a Cross-Site Request Forgery
vulnerability.

Steps for running docker image:

1. Start the server by running

    docker run -d -p 8083:80 -v $(pwd):/var/www/CSRF/Attacker --name csrf_server csrf

2. You can access the server in your browser at

    http://localhost:8083/

This is running a slightly different version of Elgg, but has the same users
and credentials.
 
Task 5: CSRF Attack using GET Request 
 
  In this task, we need two people in the Elgg social network: Alice and Boby.
  Boby wants to become a friend to Alice, but Alice refuses to add Boby to her
  Elgg friend list. Boby decides to use the CSRF attack to achieve his goal. He
  sends Alice a URL (via an email or a posting in Elgg); Alice, curious about
  it, and clicks on the URL. Pretend that you are Boby, describe how you can
  construct the content of the web page, so as soon as Alice visits the web
  page, Boby is added to the friend list of Alice (assuming Alice has an active
  session with Elgg).

  To add a friend to the victim, we need to identify the Add Friend HTTP
  request, which is a GET request. In this task, you are not allowed to write
  JavaScript code to launch the CSRF attack. Your job is to make the attack
  successful as soon as Alice visits the web page, without even making any click
  on the page (hint: you can use the img tag, which automatically triggers an
  HTTP GET request).

  Whenever the victim user visits the crafted web page in the malicious site,
  the web browser automatically issues a HTTP GET request for the URL contained
  in the img tag. Because the web browser automatically attaches the session
  cookie to the request, the trusted site cannot distinguish the malicious
  request from the genuine request and ends up processing the request
  compromising the victim user's session integrity.

  Observe the request structure for adding a new friend and then use this to
  forge a new request to the application. When the victim user visits the
  malicious web page, a malicious request for adding a friend should be injected
  into the victim's active session with Elgg.
 
  Submission: You are required to submit a file named task5.html. When a victim
  user named Alice is logged in, and visits the attacker website
  localhost:<<port>>/task5.html in another tab, Boby should be added as a friend
  to Alice's Friend List.  
 
  To test this, you will need to place the task5.html file under the directory
  /var/www/CSRF/elgg/ in the docker container. You can do this by running
  
    docker cp task5.html csrf_server:/var/www/CSRF/elgg

  Tip: Your browser may not refresh on its own. You might need to press the
  reload/refresh button to reload the page, to see if Boby is added as a friend
  to Alice's account.
