"name"="bob"
"company"="',pass='9d4e1e23bd5b727046a9e3b4b7db57bd8d6ee684' WHERE name = 'bob' -- "

First I looked in the file 'include/class.user.php' and discovered that the company variable was not 
string escaped. Then I realized that passwords were encrypted in SHA1, so I encoded by desired pass
in SHA1. I attempted to target bob by changing the ID in the WHERE clause to 3, however, IDs
seemed to be casted to int. Then I attempted to target bob by name, which only worked after inputting
bob in name(User) field.
